Abstract
The purpose of this paper is to a develop machine learning models to identify potential fraudulent transactions on Vesta’s dataset. 
The project topic is from Kaggle competition. The dataset is obtained from Vesta, the world’s leading payment service company. 
The large-scale dataset contains over 500,000 rows and 430 columns. Each row represents a transaction and each column indicates information about the identity of the customer and transaction information. The goal is to train a model that will take important features in those columns as an input then produce a target result whether that transaction is fraud or not.
